My work aligns with NASA's Exoplanet Exploration program, since it shares a common goal of characterizing planetary systems and earth-like planets. Exoplanet research is one of the fastest growing fields in astronomy---every increase in the sophistication of our observing capabilities necessitates a proportional increase in the complexity of the resultant data analysis. Spectral analysis of transiting exoplanets reveals information about the contents of their atmospheres, yet the dynamics of these environments and reasons for certain atomic abundances are not well understood. Radiation forces, for example, play a huge role in determining an atmosphere's composition and temperature profile; these forces can even exceed the gravitational forces on atoms in the upper atmosphere, causing an outflow that interacts with stellar winds.
